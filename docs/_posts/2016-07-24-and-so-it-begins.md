Years ago I thought about building a MAME arcade machine. Which at the time meant a big, boxy computer and a big, boxy CRT monitor. I never got around to it.

Then Coding Horror wrote his post about [Raspberry Pi revolutionizing emulation](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-raspberry-pi-has-revolutionized-emulation/).
Suddenly the desire to relive all those 80's arcade games came back. And to have an actual 80's style arcade cabinet.
Buttons, joystick, trackball, flashing lights, the whole works.

And so it begins...
