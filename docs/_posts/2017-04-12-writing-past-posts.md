I started this project several months ago. And at the time I did not write any posts.
I didn't even have this blog/Github project.
I've decided to go back in time and write those posts.

So over the coming weeks (or months) you'll see me creating those past posts as well as current posts.

Hopefully that's not too confusing. Because current posts may reference the as yet unwritten past posts.
I'm sure it'll work out in the end.
