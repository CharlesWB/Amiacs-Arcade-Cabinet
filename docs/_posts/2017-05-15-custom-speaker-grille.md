When I bought the small 3" (78 mm) [speakers](http://a.co/ejMOJVP) I hadn't found a speaker grille that would fit.
Every once in a while I'd look but the smallest I could find was 3.5" (90 mm).

I had recently purchased a [3D printer](http://a.co/9hegcnT) and I realized that I finally had a practical use for it.

I created a 3D printable speaker grille. Nothing fancy, a rectangular part with four mounting holes and a lot
of holes in a circular pattern. It's a component in the
[SketchUp model](/tree/master/models/).

3D printing is still new to me so getting that first layer to stick took some work. Especially all those circles.
It wasn't perfect but eventually I printed on a glass sheet which gave me a very smooth surface finish.
Even though nobody really sees it given where it is on the cabinet.

The parameters I used to print it are: 0.2 mm layer height, 0.8 mm wall thickness, and 20% infill.
