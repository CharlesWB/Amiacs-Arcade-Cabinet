As I noted in a previous post the monitor mount works fine, but because it only holds the monitor at the bottom
the top of the monitor can move around.

At the time I did a quick fix by placing a piece of MDF behind the top of the monitor. This would stop
the monitor from being pushed too far back. (Because I know the kids will touch the monitor to point
at things.) This piece is not shown in the
[SketchUp model](/tree/master/models/).

This still allowed the monitor the move forward and side to side so I tried an even cheaper fix by pushing foam
around the top corners. It worked well enough to get through play testing.

Now that I have a 3D printer I designed a custom corner brace. One each at the top corners holds the monitor in place.
No more flopping around. Like the custom speaker grille it's a component in the SketchUp model.

The parameters I used to print it are: 0.2 mm layer height, 0.8 mm wall thickness, and 20% infill.

This cabinet still has the piece of MDF at the center of the monitor so I don't know yet if that's actually needed.
Maybe with a future build I'll leave that out and try it.
