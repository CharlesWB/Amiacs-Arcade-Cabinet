Okay, so I want an 80's style arcade cabinet with buttons, joystick, trackball, and flashing lights.
What does that actually involve? Time to research what my options are.

The pictures and discussions on [Coding Horror's post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-raspberry-pi-has-revolutionized-emulation/) defined most of my choices.

Here's the wishlist I came up with:
* Controls for two players. Fun for the whole family. At least two of them anyway.
* Buttons that light up. Flashing lights are required to make it feel like an arcade.
* Joysticks with ball shaped handle. Instead of the bat shape. Just because it looks right.
* Trackball. How else can you play Centipede?
* Trackball that lights up. Need more flashing lights.
* Steering wheel. How else can you play Outrun?
* Insert coin slots. For authenticity.
* Custom graphics. More authenticity.
* Bar top size. Trying for something semi-portable.
