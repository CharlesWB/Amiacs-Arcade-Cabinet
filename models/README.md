*Cricut Design Space Import*

1. In Inkscape, select all text objects and use Path -> Object to Path.
    * Cricut Design Space didn't import text objects.
    * Use Ctrl to select into a group.
2. Upload as image to Cricut Design Space.
3. Change size of top level group to match Inkscape size.
    * Not sure why size is incorrect. Possibly due to metric/inch scaling.
    * Technically Inkscape size is .1 mm larger due to stroke thickness.
4. Ungroup top level group.
5. Select each button label group and Attach to keep the shapes together.
